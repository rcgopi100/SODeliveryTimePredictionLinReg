# SODeliveryTimePredictionLinReg
We have seen in our previous blog posts Customer Price Prediction on Machine Learning Scikit Learn Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

Also, we have gone through Customer Sales Order delivery time/days prediction using the Machine Learning Scikit Decision Tree model.

In this post, we will work on Customer Sales Order Delivery time/Days Prediction using the Scikit Learn Linear Regression model (copy most of the codes from Customer Sales Order delivery time/days prediction) and check how it performs. 

Let’s start and see how the Linear Regression predicts “Delivery days data” and you can also download from GitHub on my repository SODeliveryTimePredictionLinReg.

You can visit my webiste for all data and blog posts.
